# coding-events

The purpuse of this app is to add different events and details and the kind of event or category of that particular event and add and list the tags.
Current state of the app is it lists all the events,the category and can add new events and category and tag it the appropriate category.
The future improvement of the app: we can add a person class to it which can hold the features person id, intrested event categories and the events person registered for and can add function to list event registered and list of intrested event categories.
